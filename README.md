# one-vertex-attack

Welcome to the **One Vertex Attack against Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting** repository! This repository contains the official code implementation for the paper [One Vertex Attack against Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting]. Dive into the fascinating world of Deep Graph Neural Networks and their application in spatiotemporal traffic forecasting as we explore their capabilities, limitations, and the vulnerabilities exposed by adversarial attacks.
